Dataset is custom made using "www.makesense.ai"

Project has been run in google colab

-----------------------------------------------------------

The Dataset used for training the yolov5(in our case we used the small model, Yolov5s) model is in the following Google drive link:

(Please download the dataset while you're running this project.)

-----------------------------------------------------------

I'm also uploading "custom_dataset.yaml" file which we need to run the project, in this repo.

After downloading, before you're running this project place this ".yaml" file observing the following path (yolov5/data/custom_dataset.yaml).
