Project has been run in google colab

The Dataset used for training the yolov5(in our case we used the small model, Yolov5s) model is in the following Google drive link:

I have also provided the "custom_dataset.yaml" file in the dataset file.
Though for necessary use I'm also uploading the file in this Repo.
